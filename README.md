# Task Requirements

Write a microservice application, that implements a ‘CRUD’ with REST endpoints for JSON entity (not for all entities,
only for root entity) with the structure:
The root object is the company.     
Each company has name and departments.  
Each department has name and contains teams.    
Each team has name and project.     
Each project has a manager with contact information.

**Using**: Java 21, Spring, Postgres, Maven, GIT (local repository), Docker (just to start app)and any other    
technologies (for some converting, for example)

**Note**: keep it simple and clear, fulfilling the minimum requirements.
Push the project to the GitHub repository and share the link with us
